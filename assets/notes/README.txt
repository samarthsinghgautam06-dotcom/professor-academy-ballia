How to add notes:
1) Put your PDF files inside /assets/notes/
2) Open notes.json and add a new item with title, description, tags, and link.
3) Use the same file path in the link field, for example:
   "link": "assets/notes/your-file.pdf"
4) Commit and push to GitHub. Your notes will be public and accessible.

Tip: If you use Google Drive or another host, make sure the file is set to public and paste the public link in notes.json.
